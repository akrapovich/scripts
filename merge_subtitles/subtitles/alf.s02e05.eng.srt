1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,664
And with this remote control,
you punch in your code numbers.

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,577
Then the People Log goes on
and it records who's watching what.

3
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:18,628
You see, from this data,
we determine our ratings.

4
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,387
Cat.

5
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,183
Big cat.

6
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:36,748
- Dead cat.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,184
Well, if you have any questions...

8
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:42,466
...just call the office
and ask for Louie.

9
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,621
- I thought your name was Ron.
- It is.

10
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,378
Is he gone?

11
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,823
Yes, he...

12
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:56,419
What were you doing in there?

13
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,227
Looking for tomato paste.

14
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,425
I broke a tomato.

15
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,068
Hey, what's that?

16
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,140
A hookup for the Shopping Network?

17
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:06,943
It's a People Log.

18
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,782
We've been asked
to become a Thompson family.

19
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,179
You're changing your name
to Thompson?

20
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,580
I just learned how to spell Tanner.

21
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:21,539
We're not changing our name, ALF.
This is a Thompson People Log.

22
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,587
It measures what we watch on TV.

23
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:27,786
Great. Now I'll finally find out
who's taller...

24
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,259
...me or Michael J. Fox.

25
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:43,466
Explain how television ratings work,
will you, Willie?

26
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,384
Well, ratings are designed
primarily for advertisers...

27
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,825
...in order to assist them
in their own in-house research.

28
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,265
- They require certain demographic...
- Never mind.

29
00:02:55,429 --> 00:03:00,139
Okay. Now, every time
we watch TV, we have to log in.

30
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,459
Now, does everybody know
their code numbers?

31
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,142
- Three.
- Two.

32
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,186
- Four.
- One.

33
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,543
Wrong.

34
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,028
Twelve.

35
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,108
Wrong again.

36
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,783
Kate, if you make me guess
every number there is...

37
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,065
...we could be here for hours.

38
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,346
- ALF, that's not the point.
- I think what Kate is trying to say...

39
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:21,500
I know what Kate is trying to say.

40
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,547
I'm an alien, not a foreigner.

41
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:27,463
Okay, I can't have a number.

42
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,028
Give me a letter.

43
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,267
N-O.

44
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,979
That's two letters.

45
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,821
Just try to understand, ALF.

46
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,028
The operative word
in "People Log" is "people."

47
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,908
One of which you are not...

48
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,343
...one.

49
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,468
That's cruel.

50
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,339
Not to mention poorly constructed
from a grammatical standpoint.

51
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,982
ALF, we just don't think
that the ratings people are interested...

52
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,466
...in viewers from outer space.

53
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,903
In other words, the operative word
in "Thompson family" is "family."

54
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,458
One of which I am not...

55
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:08,664
...part of...

56
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,547
...this one.

57
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,779
You're one of the family, ALF.

58
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,064
Oh, sure.

59
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,904
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
is one of the Kennedys.

60
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,747
Why can't ALF have a number?

61
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,627
He watches TV all the time.

62
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,906
And the man did say that everyone
who watches should log in.

63
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,060
See? They're on my side.

64
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,948
You know, Willie,
maybe ALF should have a number.

65
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:33,748
We do have a responsibility
to give them all the data...

66
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,740
...as accurately as possible.

67
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:40,027
Yeah, and I love pushing
these little silver buttons.

68
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,747
All right, ALF.

69
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,467
You're number five.

70
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:45,142
Just don't break that thing.

71
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:48,221
Kate. Katie. Kate-o-nine-tails.

72
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,425
Have I ever broken anything?

73
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,858
Lately?

74
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,862
This week?

75
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,902
Today?

76
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,783
Since lunch?

77
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,223
<i>Coming up next,</i>
The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.

78
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,699
<i>But first,
weather maps of developing nations.</i>

79
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,829
Why aren't we watching
the <i>Love Connection?</i>

80
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:23,025
We're waiting
for <i>The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.</i>

81
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,225
- Well, la-di-da.
- <i>Meanwhile, in Pakistan...</i>

82
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,902
<i>... it reached a high of 98.</i>

83
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,299
I thought the popcorn popper
was broken.

84
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:30,458
It is.

85
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,018
I popped this with your curling iron.

86
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,469
I won't ask
how you melted the butter.

87
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,221
Hot comb.

88
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,787
You know, I thought
the whole point of this ratings hoo-hah...

89
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,658
...was to find out
what people really watch.

90
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,582
Well, we really watch
MacNeil and Lehrer.

91
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,627
Oh, yeah? Describe them to me.

92
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,427
Well...

93
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,821
...they wear neckties...

94
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:05,584
...and they speak
in well-modulated voices.

95
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,217
Yo, Tanners. It's me, Trevor.

96
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,658
Speaking of well-modulated voices.

97
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,459
Just a minute, Trevor.

98
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:16,778
ALF, go into the kitchen.

99
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,509
"Go into the kitchen.
Go into the kitchen."

100
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,183
As a woman,
you should be sensitive...

101
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,817
...to the demeaning undertones
in that remark.

102
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,217
Now.

103
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:29,502
You're betraying your sisters.

104
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,699
Hey, Willie. How's it going?

105
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,178
- Hi, Kate. I was...
- Hi, Trevor.

106
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,862
Hey...

107
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,021
...is this one of those box things
that lets you steal cable?

108
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,861
No, of course, it's not.

109
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,021
No, we've been asked to become
one of those TV-ratings families.

110
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,463
- No kidding?
- No.

111
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:50,982
Well, it figures.

112
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,662
You got your two adults...

113
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,389
...you got your two kids,
you got your cat...

114
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,858
...you got your average height.

115
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,299
You're the prototypical
American family.

116
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,585
Too bad this ratings stuff's a crock.

117
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:04,707
Well, why do you say that?

118
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:07,258
Because the best programs
always come in last.

119
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,704
Case in point:

120
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,097
<i>Here's Lucy Again.</i>

121
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,783
The one where she moves back in
with her mother.

122
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,341
Who could play Lucy's mother?

123
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,023
I think they use a fright wig
on a stick.

124
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,226
And then there's that other program
that's on right now.

125
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,902
<i>Polka Jamboree.</i>

126
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,378
It's like a Slavic <i>Soul Train.</i>

127
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,460
Here. Dig.

128
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,707
No, no, no, Trevor.

129
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,427
We'll tune in later.

130
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:49,946
Right now we wanted
to check out the rainfall in Sri Lanka.

131
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,701
Going on a picnic?

132
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,501
Trevor...

133
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,064
...was there something you wanted?

134
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:58,218
Oh, yeah.

135
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,664
Could you turn on our sprinklers
while we're gone?

136
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,979
Raquel and I are taking a trip
to the Big Apple.

137
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,628
Oh, New York.

138
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:06,188
No, Washington State.

139
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,581
Some farmer up there
grew an 80-pound Golden Delicious.

140
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,345
Sure, we'll be happy to water the yard,
Trevor. Where's the control?

141
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,703
I don't have one.

142
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,064
I just hook up my hose to your spigot.

143
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,265
Well, I should have no problem then.

144
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:22,782
I never do.

145
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,780
See you in a month.

146
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:31,784
<i>Polka Jamboree.</i>
Turn on <i>Polka Jamboree.</i>

147
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,986
Oh, why would you wanna watch
<i>Polka Jamboree?</i>

148
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,300
They were playing "Cat Barrel Polka."

149
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,427
That's "Beer Barrel Polka," I believe.

150
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:44,179
They put beer in barrels?

151
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,783
Well, they take the cats out first.

152
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,500
Makes sense.

153
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,662
<i>We're here in the office
of NBC Entertainment President...</i>

154
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:03,707
<i>... Brandon Tartikoff,
talking about the new rating system.</i>

155
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:05,018
Oh, boy.

156
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,864
<i>Brandon, what effect
will the new People Log system have...</i>

157
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,065
<i>... on rating trends as we know them?</i>

158
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:14,904
<i>Well, research indicates
that younger viewers will be up.</i>

159
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,821
<i>Older viewers will be down.</i>

160
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,628
<i>Females will be down.
Males will be up.</i>

161
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,507
<i>Daytime, down. Late-night, up.</i>

162
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:24,900
<i>Large audience shows,
while they'll still have a large audience...</i>

163
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:27,025
<i>... may find their audiences smaller.</i>

164
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,942
<i>Smaller audience shows
will have a larger audience...</i>

165
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:31,781
<i>... relatively speaking, of course.</i>

166
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,784
<i>But the most consistent aspect
will be the lack of ratings consistency...</i>

167
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,462
<i>... which is strangely enough...</i>

168
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:43,180
<i>... consistent with what we found
to be an overall inconsistency.</i>

169
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,943
If there's a quiz later, I'm sunk.

170
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,462
<i>One of the other networks...</i>

171
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,860
<i>... is throwing a couple of new shows
at your Thursday-night lineup.</i>

172
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,339
<i>I believe it's</i> Polka Jamboree
<i>and</i> Here's Lucy Again.

173
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,343
<i>Lucy's always formidable,
but we expect to do well.</i>

174
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,101
<i>As for</i> Polka Jamboree...

175
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,181
<i>... well, that was offered to me first
and, frankly, I passed.</i>

176
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:05,541
<i>Time's up already?</i>

177
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,586
<i>Okay, Brandon, thank you very much.</i>

178
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:11,344
<i>We'd like to thank our guests,
Brandon Tartikoff and Spuds MacKenzie.</i>

179
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,261
<i>We'll see you next week.</i>

180
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:16,784
<i>We're admitting it, we're insane.</i>

181
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,098
<i>And we eat spiders.</i>

182
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,783
<i>But you have to be insane
to eat spiders, right?</i>

183
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,177
<i>But we're not dangerous.</i>

184
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:25,625
Then why do they have you
in that straitjacket?

185
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,867
<i>So don 't be afraid to visit
our used-car emporium. Ask for...</i>

186
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,820
Hey! I wanted to watch Crazy Steve
tear a drumstick off that tarantula.

187
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,902
It's 3:00 in the morning, ALF.

188
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:44,141
Well, what's time to a spider, Willie?

189
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,906
Why is the TV in here?

190
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,742
Because I couldn't move
the refrigerator out there.

191
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,422
Don't touch that dial.

192
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,261
I love when you're assertive.

193
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,982
Go, sleep...

194
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:59,138
...now.

195
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,188
Well, can I just ask
one bedtime question?

196
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,341
Yeah, what?

197
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,307
I saw that <i>Polka Jamboree</i> tonight.

198
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,699
It's really funny.

199
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,747
Why does it get such crummy ratings?

200
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,865
For one thing...

201
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,106
...it's not supposed to be funny.

202
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,021
What's the other thing?

203
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,224
Nobody watches it.

204
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,302
- Next question.
- I thought...

205
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,380
...there was gonna be
one question here.

206
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,983
This is the bonus round.

207
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,380
What happens to a show
when its ratings are bad?

208
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,267
It gets canceled.

209
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:43,547
You mean <i>Polka Jamboree</i>
could be canceled?

210
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:45,620
We can only hope.

211
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,858
Good night, ALF.

212
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,462
Well, wait, wait.

213
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:51,939
If more people
watched <i>Polka Jamboree...</i>

214
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:53,940
...the ratings would go up, right?

215
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:58,660
Yes, but that would take a miracle.

216
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,059
A miracle, huh?

217
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:05,426
Well, just call me the miracle worker.

218
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:48,506
I can't believe you and Mr. Ochmonek
like this show.

219
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,102
It's so corny.

220
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,784
Well, one man's corn
is another man's pot roast...

221
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,382
...with gravy...

222
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,868
...and mashed potatoes.

223
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:58,018
Oh, Kate...

224
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:02,023
The kitchen is closed.
And please, turn that program off.

225
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,908
Gee, talk about a one-two punch.

226
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,708
Should I stop breathing too?

227
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,621
Oh, let him watch it, Kate.

228
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,064
That show is so bad...

229
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:14,982
...it'll be off the air soon anyway.

230
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,185
Shows what you know.

231
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:18,702
What does that mean?

232
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,860
Well, it means
your previous statement...

233
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,578
...reflected the sum total
of your knowledge on this subject.

234
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,821
Oh, thank you, Noah Webster.

235
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:30,139
Noah problem.

236
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,303
<i>Thank you, thank you...</i>

237
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:40,586
<i>... all my wonderful friends
out in Polka Land.</i>

238
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,944
- Willie, can I have an accordion?
- No.

239
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,701
<i>I have an announcement to make.</i>

240
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:48,703
<i>A dream of ours here at</i> Polka Jamboree
<i>has finally come true.</i>

241
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,542
<i>According to the latest
Thompson rating...</i>

242
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,065
<i>... our show came in number one.</i>

243
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:57,982
I did it, I did it!

244
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,502
I mean...

245
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,787
...gee, how do you suppose
that happened?

246
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:18,427
How did you make <i>Polka Jamboree</i>
come in first in the ratings?

247
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,978
What makes you think it was me?

248
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,027
In nine cases out of 10, it's you.

249
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,384
Well, maybe this is that 10th case.

250
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,141
Is it?

251
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,822
No.

252
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,504
What have you done?

253
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:38,587
Well, remember that night last week
when you told me to rig the ratings?

254
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:41,138
I never told you to rig the ratings.

255
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,584
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

256
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,944
You rigged the ratings?

257
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,462
Well, actually,
I hastened the inevitable.

258
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,860
<i>Polka Jamboree</i> was ready to explode.

259
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,179
And you lit the fuse?

260
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:58,466
I called a few people
and encouraged them to watch.

261
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,142
A few...?

262
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,459
Could you ask him?

263
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:06,380
How many people did you call?

264
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:07,984
A thousand.

265
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,548
Give or take a thousand.

266
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,504
And you say
I use the phone too much.

267
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:13,784
Hey, don't worry.

268
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:17,862
I did it during off-peak hours,
2 to 6 a.m.

269
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,147
And nothing outside
the 48 contiguous states.

270
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,822
How considerate.

271
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:28,824
Hey, my way of saying,
"I know we're on a budget."

272
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,065
A thousand phone calls.

273
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,345
Give or take a thousand.

274
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:37,343
But, you know, even 2000 people
wouldn't increase the ratings that much.

275
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,064
Unless they were each given a number...

276
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:44,346
...and logged
into the Thompson-ratings system.

277
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,661
But how did you get the figures
into their system?

278
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,707
I hooked the ratings box
to the transmission on my spaceship.

279
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:58,020
Then I shifted into sideways.

280
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:01,139
I'm ready to talk
about those phone calls now.

281
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,860
We're past that point, Willie.

282
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,739
No, we're not.

283
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,701
ALF, what you did was illegal.

284
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:18,305
Oh, like I've been to law school
and would know that.

285
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,306
What you did was wrong, ALF.
Do you understand? Wrong.

286
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:27,065
Wrong... The opposite of right.
Wrong. Wrong!

287
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:29,621
Wrong.

288
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:35,861
Oh, ALF. ALF, you bad, bad, bad jerk.

289
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,179
You lovable, huggable, adorable jerk.

290
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:40,943
But bad nonetheless.

291
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,698
Well, what can I say, Mr. Welch?

292
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,066
I really... I don't... I don't...
I don't have an explanation.

293
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:55,507
Yes, sir, I realize... I understand I turned
down <i>Polka Jamboree</i> in the first place...

294
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,739
...but let me assure you, sir, that I...

295
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,103
Hello?

296
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,748
Hello?

297
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:05,262
<i>Mr. Cosby on line one.</i>

298
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,786
Hi, Bill.

299
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,985
How are you?

300
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,619
Great episode last week
when Theo lost his comb.

301
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,986
I never, ever thought he'd find it.

302
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,506
The ratings?

303
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,465
Yeah. Talk about a shock, huh?

304
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,702
Well, we knew we couldn't be
number one forever, right?

305
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:33,383
By the way,
can you play the accordion?

306
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:36,738
Sorry, just a thought.

307
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,742
You bet
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

308
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,139
And Bill, thanks for the Jell-O.

309
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:47,623
Yes, sir?

310
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,464
Send out a memo, Barbara.
I wanna develop three new shows:

311
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,062
<i>Polka Train.</i>

312
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,823
<i>The Days and Nights
of Molly Polka.</i>

313
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,820
And something
with McLean Stevenson.

314
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,741
Right away.

315
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,707
What are you guys doing?

316
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,348
We'll work quietly.

317
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,988
Does this wastebasket go?

318
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,628
Does it have a peacock on it?

319
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,461
- Yeah.
- Leave it.

320
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,861
How about the nameplate
on the door?

321
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,223
Take it.

322
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:19,904
Hey, wait a minute.

323
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:23,106
This is the guy
who turned down <i>Polka Jamboree.</i>

324
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,419
That's why we're moving him out.

325
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,784
How about the lamp over here?

326
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,258
His new office is too small.

327
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:35,262
Excuse me, sir, you have calls waiting
from <i>60 Minutes...</i>

328
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,421
...the <i>National Enquirer,</i>
and some guy named ALF.

329
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,149
I'll call them back
when I get a new extension.

330
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,345
If I get a new extension.

331
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:48,747
This ALF guy says
he's the one responsible for the ratings.

332
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:50,904
What line?

333
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,058
Two.

334
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,938
Oh, and it was very nice
working for you, sir.

335
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,906
I'm not out of here yet.

336
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,707
Yeah, right.

337
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:07,186
- Hello?
- Are you the guy in charge?

338
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,497
Talk fast.

339
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,625
I called to say I'm sorry.

340
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:20,500
I hope people don't lose their jobs
over this Polkagate thing.

341
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,183
Yeah, me too.

342
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:26,783
Well, they shouldn't.

343
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,417
This whole thing is my fault.

344
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:33,743
- What?
- I didn't want <i>Polka Jamboree</i> canceled.

345
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,139
So I called a thousand people...

346
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,788
...give or take a thousand...

347
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:40,986
...and then I hooked up my transmission
to the TV box...

348
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,300
...and shifted into sideways.

349
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,223
This is the <i>Letterman Show,</i>
isn't it?

350
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,421
<i>No, it's ALF.</i>

351
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,023
Listen,
as long as I've got you on the phone...

352
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,259
...can I pitch a wacky idea?

353
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,177
Why not?

354
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,099
<i>Okay. Now, open mind.</i>

355
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,468
Ordinary family living a normal,
boring, suburban existence, right?

356
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:08,618
<i>Yeah.</i>

357
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,303
All of a sudden,
from out of nowhere...

358
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,620
...this spaceship
crashes into their garage, see?

359
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,620
- Spaceship?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

360
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,658
And this lovable, huggable,
adorable alien comes out.

361
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,899
Not in a million years, pal.

362
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,219
It's too far-fetched.

363
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:41,183
So, what made you change your mind
about being a Thompson family?

364
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:43,748
Our cat.

365
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,820
Big, dead one.

366
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:49,386
He kept fooling around with the buttons.

367
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,939
You sure that Louie
wasn't at the office when you called?

368
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,820
It's his day off.

369
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,661
Fine.

370
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:00,185
Just out of curiosity...

371
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,467
...who chose you
as the typical American family?

372
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,062
Computer error.

373
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,185
Had to be.

374
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,138
Where does he get off saying
we're not a typical American family?

375
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,062
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

376
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:27,618
Hey, think of me
as the son you never had.

377
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,222
We have a son.

378
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,742
Well, then think of me
as the son you never wanted.

379
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:35,621
Well, son...

380
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,508
...at least we won't have to worry
about <i>Polka Jamboree...</i>

381
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,864
...being number one anymore.

382
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,179
Shows how much you know.

383
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,577
Enlighten me...

384
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:46,228
...now.

385
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,339
Well, I started a perfectly legal
letter-writing campaign...

386
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,908
...to save the show.

387
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:56,308
Incidentally,
next time you're at the post office...

388
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:59,302
...would you pick me up
150 million stamps?

389
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:10,581
Call number 462...

390
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,263
...12 minutes to West Springfield,
Massachusetts.

391
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,067
Guilty.

392
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:17,106
Call number 463...

393
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,624
...seven minutes to Lansing, Michigan.

394
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,666
Mea culpa.

395
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:24,105
Call number 464...

396
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:25,338
This is boring, Willie.

397
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,218
I'm sorry, ALF,
maybe I should sing them to you.

398
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,028
Maybe that would be more entertaining.

399
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,658
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:37,219
I love the way your voice cracks
on those high notes.

401
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,505
I'm doing this to make a point, ALF.

402
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,866
When you've done something
really bad...

403
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,338
...then it's important
that you learn from it.

404
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:49,262
And maybe next time,
you'll be able to use better judgment.

405
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,782
Won't that be nice?

406
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,621
Yeah, real nice.

407
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,144
Go back to the phone bill.

408
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,266
Call number 464...

409
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,747
...14 minutes to Bristol, Connecticut.

410
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,901
Call number...

411
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:25,459
Call number 465, 12 minutes
to Portsmouth, Virginia.

412
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:31,226
Call number 466,
19 minutes, Paola, Kansas.

413
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,028
Call number 467...

414
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,780
